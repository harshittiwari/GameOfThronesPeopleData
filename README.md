Data is available in json format in the file peopledata.json. 
I ended up normalizing it (I didn’t spend much time cleaning it though) into csv files as well.
I have done some visualization on the data which can be found at http://harshittiwariposts.tumblr.com/post/146384892416/game-of-graphs

For Excel lovers, there is an excel file as well with all the data distributed in sheets. 
BONUS: a bonus sheet is added in the excel which contains battle data from https://github.com/chrisalbon/war_of_the_five_kings_dataset
